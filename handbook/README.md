## Introduction ##


## Time Series ##
 - Time-series Dataset
   - A series of obsrvations or data points ordered in time. 
   - Autocorrelation: It is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them.
   - Seasonality: It refers to periodic fluctuations. For example, electricity consumption is high during the day and low during night, or online sales increase during Christmas before slowing down again.
   - Stationarity: It is an important characteristic of time series. A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time. In other words, it has constant mean and variance, and covariance is independent of time.
 - Temporal Data
   - The data which is collected as time progress so there will be a time stamp of a time facotor within the data set
 - Spatial Data
   - The data which has location reference to it or is location-aware through longitude and lattitude 


## Common ML/AI Concepts ##

- Gradient Descent

- Cost Function
  - Cost Function quantifies the error between predicted values and expected values and presents it in the form of a single real number. MSE or RMSE or AUC are the cost functions to provide this value.

- Loss Function
  - Loss function is a method of evaluating how well your algorithm models your dataset. If your predictions are totally off, your loss function will output a higher number.
