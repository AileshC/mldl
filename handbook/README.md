## Time Series ##
 - Time-series Dataset
   - A series of obsrvations or data points ordered in time. 
   - Autocorrelation: It is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them.
   - Seasonality: It refers to periodic fluctuations. For example, electricity consumption is high during the day and low during night, or online sales increase during Christmas before slowing down again.
   - Stationarity: It is an important characteristic of time series. A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time. In other words, it has constant mean and variance, and covariance is independent of time.
 - Temporal Data
   - The data which is collected as time progress so there will be a time stamp of a time facotor within the data set
 - Spatial Data
   - The data which has location reference to it or is location-aware through longitude and lattitude 


## Common ML/AI Concepts ##

- Gradient Descent
  - [GRADIENT DESCENT IN A NUTSHELL: A SIMPLE INTRO TO ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR ALGORITHMS AROUND](https://builtin.com/data-science/gradient-descent)
- Cost Function
  - Cost Function quantifies the error between predicted values and expected values and presents it in the form of a single real number. MSE or RMSE or AUC are the cost functions to provide this value.

- Loss Function
  - Loss function is a method of evaluating how well your algorithm models your dataset. If your predictions are totally off, your loss function will output a higher number.
  - [What is Loss Function](https://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-to-loss-functions/) 
- Optimization 
  - It is a process of understanding information effectively. In ML/AI we use ML/AI algorithms and optimization functions inside it to learn from data. 
  - **Variable**
  - **Constraints**
  - **Objective Function**
- Generalization [Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-are-overfitting-and-underfitting-in-machine-learning-a96b30864690)
  - Generalization is the model’s ability to give sensible outputs to sets of input that it has never seen before.
- Overfitting
  - When algorithms does not generalize to data well, capture lots of noice, and learn everything (even not essential) from data
- Underfitting
  - When algorithm does not even learn key important patterns from the data, and possibly not even capture the dominant trend.
  
**Labeling in Computer Vision**
- Picture + label for training classifiers (ResNets)
- Bounding box + label for detectors (YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN…)
- Polygon + label for segmentation applications (Mask R-CNN)
